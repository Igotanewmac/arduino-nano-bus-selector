busconnect

A bus connector library.


each channel has a pcf address and a byte half.



I need commands like...

begin
utility function for declaring things


uint8_t channels[4] = { 0 };

address is both i2c and multiplexer masked together as i2c only
uses 7 bits and multiplexer only needs 1
0bMIIIIIIII
M = multiplexer
I = i2c




channelassignhardware( pcf i2c address , multiplexer address )
assigns hardware addresses to channels

pcf i2c address is the i2c address of the pcf that controls this channel
multiplexer address is 0 or 1, and defines if 



channelselectsource( channel , source );
Set a channel to a specific source.
